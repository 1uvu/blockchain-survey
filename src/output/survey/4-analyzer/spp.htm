      <td>Smart contracts can automatically perform the contract terms according to the received information, and it is one of the most important research fields in digital society. The core of smart contracts is algorithm contract, that is, the parties reach an agreement on the contents of the contract and perform the contracts according to the behaviors written in certain computer algorithms. It not only needs to make sure about the correctness of smart contracts code, but also should provide a credible contract code execution environment. Blockchain provides a trusted execution and storage environment for smart contracts by the distributed secure storage, consistency verification and encryption technology. Current challenge is how to assure that smart contract can be executed as the parties' willingness. This paper introduces formal modeling and verification in formal methods to make smart contract model and verify the properties of smart contracts. Formal methods combined with smart contracts aim to reduce the potential errors and cost during contract development process. The description of a general and formal smart contract template is provided. The tool of model checking, SPIN, is used to verify the correctness and necessary properties for a smart contract template. The research shows model checking will be useful and necessary for smart contracts.</td>

      <td>SummaryBlockchain technology has attracted considerable attention owing to its wide range of potential applications. It first appeared as a cryptocurrency, called Bitcoin, but has since been used in many other business and nonbusiness applications. Unlike most existing systems that are based on centralized frameworks, this new technology utilizes peer‐to‐peer networks and distributed systems which includes blockchain registers to store transactions. Its structure is designed as a digital log file and stored as a series of linked groups, called blocks. Each individual block is locked cryptographically with the previous block. Once a block has been added, it cannot be altered. Many security experts speculate that the inherent cryptographic nature of the blockchain system is sufficient to withstand constant hacking and security threats. However, previous studies on the security and privacy of blockchain technology have shown that many applications have fallen victim to successful cyberattacks. Owing to the increasing demand for cryptocurrency and its current security challenges, previous studies have not focused on blockchain technology cybersecurity vulnerabilities extensively. Here, our study extends upon the previous studies on vulnerabilities and investigates the types of potential attacks. Our study then provides further direction to highlight possible countermeasures against blockchain technology vulnerability to cybersecurity.Study presents a review on security threats and vulnerabilities in existing cryptocurrency systems that include the possibility of attacks with a focus on issues related to user privacy and transaction anonymity. The real attacks on blockchain systems are investigated, and current possible countermeasure methods by attack types are discussed. Furthermore, practical and academic merits to enhance the security of blockchain and limitations of state‐of‐the‐art security solutions are summarized and discussed, and future directions in area of blockchain security are suggested.\n\n                            View Figure\n</td>

In a very short time, many Blockchain systems come into being successively, whose decentration, consensus mechanisms, intelligent contract, and other characteristics make them applicable to various fields such as finance, education, medical, technology, etc. The consensus mechanism is the core of Blockchain technology. And a good consensus mechanism plays a very important role in the stable operation of the Blockchain system. The continuous improvement of consensus mechanisms such as PoW (proof-of-work), PoS (proof-of-stake), DPoS (delegated-proof-of-stake), and PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) has led to the evolution of Blockchain technology to Blockchain 3.0. Starting from the issue of Byzantine generals, this article analyzes common consensus mechanisms based on existing Blockchain applications and then evaluates their consistency. This paper has a unique perspective, selection and comment on the latest progress and important literature in the field of block chain. At last, it also has a high degree of summary and prospect to the existing problems and the future development trend.</td>

      <td>Blockchain technology is believed by many to be a game changer in many application domains. While the first generation of blockchain technology (i.e., Blockchain 1.0) is almost exclusively used for cryptocurrency, the second generation (i.e., Blockchain 2.0), as represented by Ethereum, is an open and decentralized platform enabling a new paradigm of computing—Decentralized Applications (DApps) running on top of blockchains. The rich applications and semantics of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which was previously unavailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void. We systematize three aspects of Ethereum systems security: vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses. We draw insights into vulnerability root causes, attack consequences, and defense capabilities, which shed light on future research directions.</td>

      <td>As one of the key technologies of distributed ledgers, blockchain solves the trust problem in open network without relying on any trusted third party. Its decentralized feature has a broad application prospect, but still faces scalability problem. Currently, blockchain scalability bottleneck is mainly in three aspects: performance inefficiency, high confirmation delay, and function extension. For example, Bitcoin can only deal with 7 transactions per second averagely. Obviously, it cannot meet the requirement of current digital payment scenarios, nor can it be carried in other applications such as distributed storage and credit service. What's more, different blockchain systems carry different business and requirements, so scalability is the core issue of the current development of blockchain. This paper introduces the blockchain scalability related technologies from the aspects of improving efficiency and extending functionality of blockchain system, respectively. We summarize four mainstream solutions to improve the performance of blockchain system, including Sharding mechanism, directed acyclic graph based (DAG-based), off-chain payment network and cross-chain technology. In the end, we give some suggestions for further research in blockchain scalability.</td>

Nowadays, blockchain as the key framework in the decentralized public data-ledger, has been applied to a wide range of scenarios far beyond crypto-currencies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, and insurance. This survey aims to fill the gap between the large number of studies on blockchain network, where game theory emerges as an analytical tool, and the lack of a comprehensive survey on the game theoretical approaches applied in blockchain related issues. In this paper, we review game models proposed to address common issues in the blockchain network.

      <td>Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that records all transactions in a distributed append-only public ledger called blockchain. The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin.</td>

The existing e-government systems are centralised and thus subject to single point of failure. This paper proposes a secure and decentralised e-government system based on the consortium blockchain technology, which is a semi-public and decentralised blockchain system consisting of a group of pre-selected entities or organisations in charge of consensus and decisions making for the benefit of the whole network of peers. In addition, a number of e-government nodes are pre-selected to perform the tasks of user and transaction validation before being added to the blockchain network. Accordingly, e-government users of the consortium blockchain network are given the rights to create, submit, access, and review transactions. Performance evaluation on single transaction time and transactions processed per second demonstrate the practicability of the proposed consortium blockchain-based e-government system for secure information sharing amongst all stakeholders.</td>

This article aims to explore the potential of DLTs and blockchain to combat fake news, reviewing initiatives that are currently under development and identifying their main current challenges. Moreover, some recommendations are enumerated to guide future researchers on issues that will have to be tackled to face fake news, as an integral part of strengthening the resilience against cyber-threats of today's online media.</td>

      <td>In cryptocurrencies, transaction fees are typically exclusively paid in the native platform currency. This restriction causes a wide range of challenges, such as deteriorated user experience, mandatory rent payments by decentralized applications, and blockchain community rivalries (e.g., coinism). Ideally, in a truly permissionless blockchain, transaction fees should be payable in any other cryptocurrency via so-called metatransactions. In this paper, we formalize metatransactions, review existing ideas, and describe novel metatransaction design approaches. Under the assumption of sufficient market liquidity, we argue that metatransactions do not lower the security of cryptocurrency platforms. However, without changing the underlying blockchain, metatransaction designs typically increase transaction costs and reduce the blockchain transaction throughput.</td>

This makes it difficult for users to utilise a large number of applications on different blockchain projects.

      <td>The availability of sophisticated technologies and methods of perpetrating criminogenic activities in the cyberspace is a pertinent societal problem. Darknet is an encrypted network technology that uses the internet infrastructure and can only be accessed using special network configuration and software tools to access its contents which are not indexed by search engines. Over the years darknets traditionally are used for criminogenic activities and famously acclaimed to promote cybercrime, procurements of illegal drugs, arms deals, and cryptocurrency markets. In countries with oppressive regimes, censorship of digital communications, and strict policies prompted journalists and freedom fighters to seek freedom using darknet technologies anonymously while others simply exploit it for illegal activities. Recently, MIT's Lincoln Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence augmented a tool that can be used to expose illegal activities behind the darknet. We studied relevant literature reviews to help researchers to better understand the darknet technologies, identify future areas of research on the darknet and ultimately to optimize how data-driven insights can be utilized to support governmental agencies in unraveling the depths of darknet technologies. This paper focuses on the use of the internet for crimes, deanonymization of TOR-services, darknet a new digital street for illicit drugs, research questions and hypothesis to guide researchers in further studies. Finally, in this study, we propose a model to examine and investigate anonymous online illicit markets.</td>

A majority of security issues arise because of the centralized architecture of IoT systems. Another concern is the lack of proper authentication and access control schemes to moderate access to information generated by the IoT devices. So the question that arises is how to ensure the identity of the equipment or the communicating node. The answer to secure operations in a trustless environment brings us to the decentralized solution of Blockchain. A lot of research has been going on in the area of convergence of IoT and Blockchain, and it has resulted in some remarkable progress in addressing some of the significant issues in the IoT arena. This work reviews the challenges and threats in the IoT environment and how integration with Blockchain can resolve some of them.</td>

Cyber threats are growing at an explosive pace making the existing security and privacy measures inadequate. Hence, everyone on the Internet is a product for hackers. Consequently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to produce accurate outputs from large complex databases, where the generated outputs can be used to predict and detect vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems. Furthermore, Blockchain (BC) techniques are becoming popular in modern IoT applications to solve security and privacy issues. Several studies have been conducted on either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies target either security or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques, thus posing a need for a combined survey on efforts made in recent years addressing both security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques. In this paper, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years, starting from 2008 to 2019, addressing security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BCtechniques in the IoT domain. First, we discuss and categorize various security and privacy threats reported in the past twelve years in the IoT domain. Then, we classify the literature on security and privacy efforts based on ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. Finally, we identify and illuminate several challenges and future research directions in using ML algorithms and BC techniques to address security and privacy issues in the IoT domain.</td>

Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin-like online transactions. Then, we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain with respect to concept, attributes, techniques, and systems.</td>

In this paper we survey the 21,270 vulnerable contracts reported by five recent academic projects. Contrary to what might have been believed given the reported number of vulnerable contracts, there has been precious little in terms of actual exploitation when it comes to these vulnerabilities. We find that at most 504 out of 21,270 contracts have been subjected to exploits. This corresponds to at most 9,094 ETH (1 million USD), or only 0.30% of the 3 million ETH (350 million USD) claimed in some of the papers. While we are certainly not implying that smart contract vulnerability research is without merit, our results suggest that the potential impact of vulnerable code had been greatly exaggerated.</td>

The protocol realises this by specifying the sufficient set of data structures, abstractions, and semantics of a communication protocol which once implemented by participating ledgers will allow them to safely communicate.

We analyze both in-production and research systems in four dimensions: distributed ledger, cryptography, consensus protocol, and smart contract. We then present BLOCKBENCH, a benchmarking framework for understanding performance of private blockchains against data processing workloads. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of three major blockchain systems based on BLOCKBENCH, namely Ethereum, Parity, and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate several trade-offs in the design space, as well as big performance gaps between blockchain and database systems.

Managing and verifying transactions and issuing of bitcoins are performed collectively by peers in the network. Since pseudonyms are used without providing any identity, it is perceived that Bitcoin provides anonymity. However, it is one of the most transparent payment networks since all transactions are publicly announced. Blockchain, which is the public ledger of Bitcoin, includes all transactions to prevent double-spending and to provide integrity. By using data in the blockchain, flow of bitcoins between transactions can be observed and activities of the users can be traced. When the implications obtained from the blockchain are combined with external data, identity and profile of a user can be revealed. This possibility has undesirable effects such as spending history of a user becomes accessible to other people, or cash flow of a merchant becomes exposed to competitors. There are several proposals as extensions or alternatives to Bitcoin, which improve anonymity and privacy. This survey presents an overview and detailed investigation of anonymity and privacy in Bitcoin-like digital cash systems.

As the oil and gas industry is gradually shifting toward intelligence and digitalization, many large oil and gas companies were working on blockchain technology in the past two years because of it can significantly improve the management level, efficiency, and data security of the oil and gas industry. This paper aims to let more people in the oil and gas industry understand the blockchain and lead more thinking about how to apply the blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest papers on the review of the blockchain system in the oil and gas industry. This paper first presents the relevant theories and core technologies of the blockchain, and then describes how the blockchain is applied to the oil and gas industry from four aspects: trading, management and decision making, supervision, and cyber security. Finally, the application status, the understanding level of the blockchain in the oil and gas industry, opportunities, challenges, and risks and development trends are analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) at present, Europe and Asia have the fastest pace of developing the application of blockchain in the oil and gas industry, but there are still few oil and gas blockchain projects in operation or testing worldwide; 2) nowadays, the understanding of blockchain in the oil and gas industry is not sufficiently enough, the application is still in the experimental stage, and the investment is not enough; and (3) blockchain can bring many opportunities to the oil and gas industry, such as reducing transaction costs and improving transparency and efficiency. However, since it is still in the early stage of the application, there are still many challenges, primarily technological, and regulatory and system transformation. The development of blockchains in the oil and gas industry will move toward hybrid blockchain architecture, multi-technology combination, cross-chain, hybrid consensus mechanisms, and more interdisciplinary professionals.</td>

      <td>Network security is consequential prospect while working over the internet, LAN or other networks. Data security must be high precedence when it comes to network setup. Data security assures that shared data is kept secure. In the network, data security is crucial against attackers and hackers. The data security is all about first to secure the information from pirated access and the second one is to protect from thwart hackers. The objective of network security is to keep the network running and safe for all legitimate users. The target of this paper is to present the merits and demerits of blockchain over data security in different sectors. The blockchain technology is used in various applications to store exchanges of values via transactions. All transactions made by nodes are signed digitally with the preceding transaction hash and the public key of the destination node; this scheme guarantees that transactions are tamper-proof. A block containing transactions will be approved by specific blockchain nodes. In block-chain technology, each page in a ledger of transactions forms a block. That block affects the next block or page through cryptographic hashing. In other words, when a block is finally completed, it creates a special secure code, that links to the next page or block, creating a chain of blocks, or block-chain. Data security can be accomplished using the block-chain concept. The hash tables of raw data files are stored on the blockchain, and other copies are validated by a hashing technique. Thus any interference with the data will be instantly found because the initial hash tables are stored on thousands of nodes.</td>

      <td>Blockchains offer a decentralized, immutable and verifiable ledger that can record transactions of digital assets, provoking a radical change in several innovative scenarios, such as smart cities, eHealth or eGovernment. However, blockchains are subject to different scalability, security and potential privacy issues, such as transaction linkability, crypto-keys management (e.g. recovery), on-chain data privacy, or compliance with privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR). To deal with these challenges, novel privacy-preserving solutions for blockchain based on crypto-privacy techniques are emerging to empower users with mechanisms to become anonymous and take control of their personal data during their digital transactions of any kind in the ledger, following a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model. In this sense, this paper performs a systematic review of the current state of the art on privacy-preserving research solutions and mechanisms in blockchain, as well as the main associated privacy challenges in this promising and disrupting technology. The survey covers privacy techniques in public and permissionless blockchains, e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as privacy-preserving research proposals and solutions in permissioned and private blockchains. Diverse blockchain scenarios are analyzed, encompassing, eGovernment, eHealth, cryptocurrencies, Smart cities, and Cooperative ITS.</td>

      <td>A smart contract is an agreement between two or more parties, which is executed by the computer code. The code does the execution without giving either party the ability to back out, so it ensures the trustless execution. The smart contract is one of the most important features in blockchain applications, which implements trusted transactions without third parties. However, with the rapid development, blockchain smart contracts have also exposed many security problems, and some attacks caused by contract vulnerabilities have led to terrible losses. In order to better deal with such dilemma, making a comprehensive survey about the security verification of blockchain smart contracts from major scientific databases is quite indispensable. Even though the significance of studying security verification of blockchain smart contracts is evident, it is really fresh yet. The major contributions of our survey work come from three aspects. First, after retrieving all-sided research studies, we select 53 most related papers to show the state-of-the art of this topic, where 20 papers focus on dealing with security assurance of blockchain smart contracts, and 33 papers focus on the correctness verification of blockchain smart contracts. Second, we propose a taxonomy toward the topic of security verification of blockchain smart contracts and discuss the pros and cons of each category of related studies. Third, through in-depth analysis of these studies, we come to know that the correctness verification of smart contracts based on the formal method has already become the more significant and more effective method to validate whether a smart contract is credible and accurate. So, we further present representative studies of formal verification of smart contracts in detail to demonstrate that using a formal method to validate blockchain smart contracts must have a promising and meritorious future.</td>

With the decentralization nature, the design of IoT and blockchain aligns with each other well. Blockchain has been integrated with the IoT to solve the existing IoT problems. Our research focuses on analyzing the solutions proposed in academia and the methodologies used to integrate blockchain with the IoT. Through conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on peer-reviewed, published articles on blockchain-based solutions for IoT, we gather the knowledge on current technical approaches implemented to integrate blockchain into the IoT. Majority of the research in this space is either at a conceptual level or at a very early stage. However, we only found 35 published papers with the real implementation of blockchain in the IoT platforms. We elicit the challenges of the IoT that were being addressed, and the detailed design of the blockchain-based solutions from two perspectives, namely data management and thing management. The evaluation methods and metrics used by those works are also being recorded and analyzed. In addition to the analysis of the literature, we provide our insights on improving the existing solutions and research methodology based on our expertise and experience on the blockchain.</td>

In order to avoid this, formal verification methods can be used to ensure that the contract behaves according to given specifications. This paper presents a survey of the state of the art of formal verification of smart contracts. Being a relatively new research area, a standard or best practice for formal verification of smart contracts has not yet been established. Thus, several different methods and approaches have been used to perform the formal verification. The survey presented in this paper shows that some variant of model checking or theorem proving methodology seems to be most successful.

In the last two decades, numerous IoT solutions have been developed by small, medium-sized, and large enterprises to make our lives easier. Furthermore, private and academic researchers have extensively investigated some practical IoT solutions. The rapid expansion of IoT solutions accompanies numerous security concerns because the underlying IoT protocols and communication technologies have not considered security. Recently, blockchain has emerged to become one of the promising technologies that might overcome some of the IoT limitations (security limitations, in particular). Blockchain technology is a database ledger that uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) network and stores transactions and asset registries. Blockchain can be described as a mounting list of records (i.e., blocks) with the following properties: distributed, decentralized, immutable, and shared. This paper surveyed recent security advances to overcome IoT limitations using blockchain. In this article, the blockchain attempts to overcome IoT limitations that are related to cyber security have been classified into four categories: end-to-end traceability; data privacy and anonymity; identity verification and authentication; and confidentiality, data integrity, and availability (CIA). Intended as a guideline for future research, this paper also explores systematic processes.</td>

Most of the devices involved in blockchain-related processes are specially designed targeting only the mining aspect, i.e., solving the computational puzzle task. At the same time, the use of wearable and mobile devices may also become a part of eCommerce blockchain operation, especially during the on-charge time. The paper considers the possibility of using a large number of constrained devices to support the operation of the blockchain with a low impact on battery consumption. The utilization of such devices is expected to improve the system efficiency as well as to attract a more substantial number of users. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge with a survey of the main applications of blockchain for smartphones along with existing mobile blockchain projects. It also proposes a novel consensus protocol based on a combination of Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Activity (PoA), and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithms for efficient and on-the-fly utilization on resource-constrained devices. The system was deployed in a worldwide testnet with more than two thousand smartphones and compared with other projects from the user-experienced metrics perspective. The results prove that the utilization of PoA systems on a smartphone does not significantly affect the lifetime of the smartphone battery while existing methods based on PoW have a tremendous negative impact. Finally, the main open challenges and future investigation directions are outlined.</td>

      <td>Due to the proliferation of ICT during the last few decades, there is an exponential increase in the usage of various smart applications such as smart farming, smart healthcare, supply-chain &amp; logistics, business, tourism and hospitality, energy management etc. However, for all the aforementioned applications, security and privacy are major concerns keeping in view of the usage of the open channel, i.e., Internet for data transfer. Although many security solutions and standards have been proposed over the years to enhance the security levels of aforementioned smart applications, but the existing solutions are either based upon the centralized architecture (having single point of failure) or having high computation and communication costs. Moreover, most of the existing security solutions have focussed only on few aspects and fail to address scalability, robustness, data storage, network latency, auditability, immutability, and traceability. To handle the aforementioned issues, blockchain technology can be one of the solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we present a systematic review of various blockchain-based solutions and their applicability in various Industry 4.0-based applications. Our contributions in this paper are in four fold. Firstly, we explored the current state-of-the-art solutions in the blockchain technology for the smart applications. Then, we illustrated the reference architecture used for the blockchain applicability in various Industry 4.0 applications. Then, merits and demerits of the traditional security solutions are also discussed in comparison to their countermeasures. Finally, we provided a comparison of existing blockchain-based security solutions using various parameters to provide deep insights to the readers about its applicability in various applications.</td>

Moreover, the ability to detect such malicious attacks is critical for conducting necessary mitigation, at an early stage, to minimise the impact of disruption and restore cloud operations and their live migration processes. This paper presents an overview of cloud architecture and categorises potential state-of-the-art security events based on their occurrence at different cloud deployment models. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) in the cloud, involving types of classification and common detection approaches, are also described. Collaborative NIDSs for cloud-based blockchain applications are also explained to demonstrate how blockchain can address challenges related to data privacy and trust management.

This paper outlines the existing solutions to blockchain scalability, which can be classified into two categories: first layer and second layer solutions. First layer solutions propose modifications to the blockchain (i.e., changing the blockchain structure, such as block size) while second layer solutions propose mechanisms that are implemented outside of the blockchain. In particular, we focus on sharding as a promising first layer solution to the scalability issue; the basic idea behind sharding is to divide the blockchain network into multiple committees, each processing a separate set of transactions. More specifically, (a) we propose a taxonomy based on committee formation and intra-committee consensus; and (b) we compare the main existing sharding-based blockchain protocols. We also present a performance-based comparative analysis (i.e., throughput and latency), of the advantages, and disadvantages in existing scalability solutions.</td>

In SDN, the network intelligence is centralized in a software entity so-called SDN controller, which enables network administrators to dynamically manage, secure, and optimize network resources and programmatically shape all entire network traffic pattern. Despite the impressive benefits SDN has brought to network architecture, it introduces new security challenges and prompts different implementation strategies to spread attack vectors.

These requirements include Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications, Massive Machine-Type Communications and Enhanced Mobile Broadband. To realize such features in 5G and beyond, there is a need to rethink how current cellular networks are deployed because designing new radio access technologies and utilizing the new spectrum are not enough. Several technologies, such as software-defined networking, network function virtualization, machine learning and cloud computing, are being integrated into the 5G networks to fulfil the need for diverse requirements. These technologies, however, give rise to several challenges associated with decentralization, transparency, interoperability, privacy and security. To address these issues, Blockchain has emerged as a potential solution due to its capabilities such as transparency, data encryption, auditability, immutability and distributed architecture. In this paper, we review the state-of-art application of Blockchain in 5G network and explore how it can facilitate enabling technologies of 5G and beyond to enable various services at the front-haul, edge and the core. Based on the review, we present a taxonomy of Blockchain application in 5G networks and discuss several issues that can be solved using Blockchain integration. We then present various field-trials and Proof of concept that are using Blockchain to address the challenges faced in the current 5G deployment. Finally, we discuss various challenges that need to be addressed to realize the full potential of Blockchain in beyond 5G networks.

Thus, it is imperative to understand the key components, functional characteristics, and architecture of different consensus algorithms used in CPS. Many consensus algorithms exist in the literature with a specified set of functionalities, performance, and computing services. Motivated from these facts, in this survey, we present a comprehensive analysis of existing state-of-the-art consensus mechanisms and highlight their strength and weaknesses in decentralized CPS applications.

Bitcoin is a currency that is used digitally and globally as a system currency. It permits people to send and receive cash through the internet, even to a less-trusted person. Money can also be exchanged without knowing the real identity. The mathematics of cryptography form the fundamentals of bitcoin’s security. Cryptocurrency wallets also get hacked usually, but the hack is not the usual one, outstanding at the blockchain itself. Chain is a company that creates cryptographic ledgers like blockchains for security in financial services. The tools helped banks and credit-card companies to securely store and manage their assets.

Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges.The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities &amp; the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared-access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time.The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry.</td>

Over recent years, many studies have been done to cope with this problem. In this paper, a comparative and analytical review on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus algorithms is presented to enlighten the strengths and constraints of each algorithm. Based on their inherent specifications, each algorithm has a different domain of applicability that yields to propose several performance criteria for the evaluation of these algorithms. To overview and provide a basis of comparison for further work in the field, a set of incommensurable and conflicting performance evaluation criteria is identified and weighted by the pairwise comparison method. These criteria are classified into four categories including algorithms’ throughput, the profitability of mining, degree of decentralization and consensus algorithms vulnerabilities and security issues. Based on the proposed framework, the pros and cons of consensus algorithms are systematically analyzed and compared in order to provide a deep understanding of the existing research challenges and clarify the future study directions.</td>

Backward-reference list checking was conducted to identify other relevant references. Study selection process was performed in three steps based on PRISMA flow diagram. Extracted data were synthesised and presented narratively using tables and figures.ResultsThe search resulted in 84 relevant studies that have been conducted of which only 37 unique studies were included in this review. Eight benefits of blockchain were categorised in either patient related-benefits (security and authorisation, personalised healthcare, patients' health data tracking, and patient’s health status monitoring) or organisational-related benefits (health information exchange, pharmaceutical supply chain, clinical trials, and medical insurance management). Meanwhile, eight threats of blockchain were categorised into three groups: organisational threats (installation and transaction costs, interoperability issues, and lack of technical skills), social threats (social acceptance and regulations issues), and technological threats (scalability issues, authorisation and security issues, high energy consumption, and slow processing speeds).ConclusionBlockchain is a viable technology that can improve the healthcare data sharing and storing system owing to its decentralisation, immutability, transparency and traceability features. However, many healthcare organisations remain hesitant to adopt blockchain technology due to threats such as security and authorisation issues, interoperability issues and lack of technical skills related to blockchain technology.</td>

Traditional Internet of Things (IoT) traceability systems provide the feasible solutions for the quality monitoring and traceability of food supply chains. However, most of the IoT solutions rely on the centralized server-client paradigm that makes it difficult for consumers to acquire all transaction information and to track the origins of products. Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that has great potential for improving traceability performance by providing security and full transparency. However, the benefits, challenges and development methods of blockchain-based food traceability systems are not yet fully explored in the current literature. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to review the blockchain technology characteristics and functionalities, identify blockchain-based solutions for addressing food traceability concerns, highlight the benefits and challenges of blockchain-based traceability systems implementation, and help researchers and practitioners to apply blockchain technology based food traceability systems by proposing an architecture design framework and suitability application analysis flowchart of blockchain based food traceability systems. The results of this study contribute to better understanding and knowledge on how to improve the food traceability by developing and implementing blockchain-based traceability systems.

However, smart healthcare systems are highly vulnerable to several security breaches and various malignant attacks, such as privacy leakage, tempering, forgery, etc. Recently, the blockchain technology emerged as a propitious solution against such breaches and challenges. This paper presents an up-to-date survey on different challenges and open issues faced in smart healthcare due to the traditional security measures along with the security requirements of such domains. It also amalgamates the potentials of blockchain technology as a promising security measure, highlights potential challenges in the healthcare domain, and provides an analysis of different blockchain-based security solutions.</td>

The blockchain technique, due to its decentralization and information disclosure, was proposed as a decentralized and distributed approach to guarantee security requirements and motivate the development of the IoT and IIoT. In this paper, we first introduce the basic structure and main features of blockchain and summarize the security requirements to develop IoT and Industry 4.0. Then, we explore how blockchain can be applied to the IoT for Industry 4.0 using its security tools and technology. We describe the most relevant blockchain-based IoT applications to promote the functions and advantages of the blockchain technique on IoT and IIoT platforms.

      <td>AbstractThe recent advancement in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in terms of manufacturing processes, and communication and networking technology has led to a rise in their usage in civilian and commercial applications. The regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US had earlier limited the usage of UAVs to military applications. However more recently, the FAA has outlined new enforcement that will also expand the usage of UAVs in civilian and commercial applications. Due to being deployed in open atmosphere, UAVs are vulnerable to being lost, destroyed or physically hijacked. With the UAV technology becoming ubiquitous, various issues in UAV networks such as intra-UAV communication, UAV security, air data security, data storage and management, etc. need to be addressed. Blockchain being a distributed ledger protects the shared data using cryptography techniques such as hash functions and public key encryption. It can also be used for assuring the truthfulness of the information stored and for improving the security and transparency of the UAVs. In this paper, we review various applications of blockchain in UAV networks such as network security, decentralized storage, inventory management, surveillance, etc., and discuss some broader perspectives in this regard. We also discuss various challenges to be addressed in the integration of blockchain and UAVs and suggest some future research directions.</td>

      <td>AbstractIn recent years, the growing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) is providing a promising opportunity not only for the development of various home automation systems but also for different industrial applications. By leveraging these benefits, automation is brought about in the industries giving rise to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IoT is prone to several cyberattacks and needs challenging approaches to achieve the desired security. Moreover, with the emergence of IIoT, the security vulnerabilities posed by it are even more devastating. Therefore, in order to provide a guideline to researchers, this survey primarily attempts to classify the attacks based on the objects of vulnerability. Subsequently, each of the individual attacks is mapped to one or more layers of the generalized IoT/IIoT architecture followed by a discussion on the countermeasures proposed in literature. Some relevant real-life attacks for each of these categories are also discussed. We further discuss the countermeasures proposed for the most relevant security threats in IIoT. A case study on two of the most important industrial IoT applications is also highlighted. Next, we explore the challenges brought by the centralized IoT/IIoT architecture and how blockchain can effectively be used towards addressing such challenges. In this context, we also discuss in detail one IoT specific Blockchain design known as Tangle, its merits and demerits. We further highlight the most relevant Blockchain-based solutions provided in recent times to counter the challenges posed by the traditional cloud-centered applications. The blockchain-related solutions provided in the context of two of the most relevant applications for each of IoT and IIoT is also discussed. Subsequently, we design a taxonomy of the security research areas in IoT/IIoT along with their corresponding solutions. Finally, several open research directions relevant to the focus of this survey are identified.</td>

      <td>AbstractNow reaching 2020, the world is witnessing the initial diffusion of 5G networks, which promise to revolutionize the mobile wireless communications, providing faster services, very low delays, and a very pervasive connectivity via mobile devices. It is worth to remark that the main paradigm which will take advantage from 5G is really the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the spreading of 5G technology also generates important concerns in terms of security and privacy, due to the continuous and wireless connection to the network, which hinders the reliability of the involved devices. This paper deeply analyzed the current state of the art about the existing security and privacy solutions tailored to 5G. More in detail, the following requirements are discussed: data integrity, confidentiality, authentication, access control, non-repudiation, trust, privacy, identity management, key management, policy enforcement, and intrusion detection. Furthermore, the paper aims to shed the light on future research directions towards the realization of secure and privacy aware 5G systems. To this end, the role of emerging paradigms, such as IoT, fog computing, and blockchain is investigated.</td>

The 5G technologies target to support diverse vertical applications by connecting heterogeneous devices and machines with drastic improvements in terms of high quality of service, increased network capacity and enhanced system throughput. However, 5G systems still remain a number of security challenges that have been mentioned by researchers and organizations, including decentralization, transparency, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the conventional techniques may not be sufficient to deal with the security requirements of 5G. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Motivated from these facts, in this paper we provide a state-of-the-art survey on the integration of blockchain with 5G networks and beyond. In this detailed survey, our primary focus is on the extensive discussions on the potential of blockchain for enabling key 5G technologies, including cloud computing, edge computing, Network Function Virtualization, Network Slicing, and D2D communications. We then explore and analyse the opportunities that blockchain potentially empowers important 5G services, ranging from spectrum management, data sharing, network virtualization, resource management to interference management, federated learning, privacy and security provision. The recent advances in the applications of blockchain in 5G Internet of Things are also surveyed in a wide range of popular use-case domains, such as smart healthcare, smart city, smart transportation, smart grid and UAVs. The main findings derived from the comprehensive survey on the cooperated blockchain-5G networks and services are then summarized, and possible research challenges with open issues are also identified. Lastly, we complete this survey by shedding new light on future directions of research on this newly emerging area.</td>

In recent years, equity crowdfunding in China has experienced some developments. However, some problems remain unsolved in practice. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology to ensure data security, transparency, and integrity. Because it cannot be tampered with or forged, the technology is deemed to have great potential in the finance industry. This study examines current problems in the practice of equity crowdfunding in China. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of blockchain technology, this study further explores its practical applications in equity crowdfunding. 1) Blockchain technology may be a secure, efficient, low-cost solution for the registration of stocks and shares of a firm financed by crowdfunding; 2) Blockchain technology simplifies the transaction and transfer of crowdfunding equities, and thus facilitates their circulation; 3) Blockchain technology enables peer to peer transactions between investors and entrepreneurs, and solves the problems of regulatory compliance and security of fund management; Blockchain technology can be used to develop a voting system for crowdfunders, which enables them to be involved in corporate governance. This helps protect the rights and interests of small investors; 5) Blockchain technology helps regulators know about market conditions, and supports regulatory activities such as managing investors and fighting money laundering.</td>

A new technology, Blockchain, may be a key to addressing these challenges and should draw the attention of the whole clinical research community.Blockchain brings the Internet to its definitive decentralisation goal. The core principle of Blockchain is that any service relying on trusted third parties can be built in a transparent, decentralised, secure “trustless” manner at the top of the Blockchain (in fact, there is trust, but it is hardcoded in the Blockchain protocol via a complex cryptographic algorithm). Therefore, users have a high degree of control over and autonomy and trust of the data and its integrity. Blockchain allows for reaching a substantial level of historicity and inviolability of data for the whole document flow in a clinical trial. Hence, it ensures traceability, prevents a posteriori reconstruction and allows for securely automating the clinical trial through what are called Smart Contracts. At the same time, the technology ensures fine-grained control of the data, its security and its shareable parameters, for a single patient or group of patients or clinical trial stakeholders.In this commentary article, we explore the core functionalities of Blockchain applied to clinical trials and we illustrate concretely its general principle in the context of consent to a trial protocol. Trying to figure out the potential impact of Blockchain implementations in the setting of clinical trials will shed new light on how modern clinical trial methods could evolve and benefit from Blockchain technologies in order to tackle the aforementioned challenges.</td>

As part of the response to the incident, the Ethereum Foundation issued two guidelines: a security measure and a value limit. However, the characteristics of decentralized blockchain platforms make it difficult to establish or enforce new rules. In this paper, we investigate whether these guidelines had any influence on subsequent crowdfunding projects, by qualitatively analyzing the information provided by the projects’ organizers. The results indicate that the Ethereum Foundation guidelines had some, although limited, influence on how the projects were conducted, in particular with regard to setting a value limit to the campaigns. They also provide some evidence of the influence of the community in the implementation and improvement of security measures related to the smart contracts.

      <td>Ride-hailing service is gaining an increasing popularity due to its great advantages on fare estimation, automatic payments, and reputation ratings. However, how to build the trust between the driver and the passenger and achieve the secure billing still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes a novel secure billing protocol which removes the presence of the online third party by a smart contract on a publicly-verifiable two-party blockchain. In the proposed secure billing protocol, the driver and the passenger generate a blockchain which contains information about the ride. The driver and the passenger measure their own trajectories respectively in rounds. At the end of each round, they exchange their trajectories of the current round. If the difference of trajectories is within a threshold, they jointly compute the fare of current round. After completing the computation, the passenger pays the driver the fare of the current round via a micropayment channel. The driver and the passenger end each round by adding the information generated in this round into the blockchain. The blockchain can be considered as an evidence of the ride since it contains all the information of the ride. We evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed protocol via extensive experiments and detailed analysis.</td>

In a cyber-physical system-of-systems (CPSoS), systems communicate by exchanging and sharing data and information, which this chapter also refers to as interoperability of information. To ensure reliable and secure interoperability of information between distributed cyber-physical systems, using blockchain technology or distributed ledging technology for distributed entities is an interesting option. Such a blockchain must, at a minimum, be fault tolerant and enable the entities involved to reach consensus on the information transactions that are to be performed. Once consensus about transactions between cyber-physicals is reached, it must be possible for these to record consistently the used data in a distributed ledger that provides a permanent shared overview of completed information transactions. The development of the new technology we call blockchain creates a new and as yet unfathomable reality of interconnected autonomous and self-organising cyber-physical systems that have the ability to make decisions about or for us as human beings.</td>

This paper summarizes the obstacles of IoT in terms of security and efficient operation network and introduces the Blockchain to solve these problems. Nowadays, many IoT application use the traditional central structure and collect all data in one center node. However, with connected devices on the rise, it is required that the center node should have a huge computing power, storage space and bandwidth, thus making the operation cost become higher. For IoT, another focus is all about private and security. All transaction data are stored in the third party, which means hackers can break security barriers and steal user information easily. Moreover, some businessmen will sell user information to other parties without owner’s authorization. Through this paper we find that Blockchain can provide a distributed, transparent platform with trustless mechanism and collective maintenance of security for the IoT. But, applying Blockchain directly to IoT may result in many problems, such as limited resource, longer delays, poor scalability. At present, there is not a Blockchain model which can be applied in large scale IoT networks. The future study can be followed along this line.</td>

A smart contract is a mechanism involving digital assets and some parties, where the parties deposit assets into the contract and the contract redistributes the assets among the parties based on provisions of the smart contract and inputs of the parties. Recently, several smart contract systems are constructed that use zk-SNARKs to provide privacy-preserving payments and interconnections in the contracts (e.g. Hawk [KMS+16] and Gyges [JKS16]). Efficiency of such systems severely are dominated by efficiency of the underlying UC-secure zk-SNARK that is achieved using C\(\emptyset \)C\(\emptyset \) framework [KZM+15] applied on a non-UC-secure zk-SNARK. In this paper, we show that recent progresses on zk-SNARKs, allow one to simplify the structure and also improve the efficiency of both systems with a UC-secure zk-SNARK that has simpler construction and better efficiency in comparison with the currently used ones. More precisely, with minimal changes, we present a variation of Groth and Maller’s zk-SNARK from Crypto 2017, and show that it achieves UC-security and has better efficiency than the ones that currently are used in Hawk and Gyges. We believe, new variation can be of independent interest.\n\n</td>

In this paper we analyse how the blockchain can be exploited beyond these traditional tasks, towards coordination of distributed processes. To this end, we design and develop proof-of-concept implementations of the Linda model on top of different blockchains, and compare their strengths and shortcomings.</td>

      <td>Academic and business interest in blockchain and its potential benefits for businesses has risen considerably since 2016. Blockchain is considered as a distributed ledger technology that records transactions between parties in a protected and permanent way and enables transferring data and assets easily without relying on a third-party intermediary. Current supply chains are mostly linear and heavily complex networks with various stakeholders which often causes low transparency, data silos and unstandardized processes. The aim of this paper is first, to analyze the overall perspectives of blockchain technology and second, to investigate the potentials of blockchain to enable sustainable supply chains which would eliminate many shortcomings in current supply chains. This paper analyses three cases which exploited the potentials of blockchain technology with the aim of promoting sustainable sourcing from origin to consumers. The analysis compares three different cases of global supply chains, with a focus on corporate sustainability in agriculture, and manufactured goods. The results of our analysis show that blockchain has the potential to boost the supply chain sustainability, however the blockchain can’t guarantee that all supply chain stakeholders provide accurate, uniform and verifiable data. This paper provides a conceptual framework to better understand the benefits and challenges of the blockchain technology. Both academics and practitioners in companies might find this framework useful, as it outlines important lines of research in the field.</td>

      <td>Blockchain is a technology that is developed using a combination of various techniques such as mathematics, algorithms, cryptography, economic models, etc. Blockchain is a public ledger of all crypto currency transactions that are digitized and decentralized. All the transactions of cryptocurrencies are stored in chronological order to help users in tracking the transactions without maintaining any central record of the transactions. Application prospects of blockchain are promising and have been delivering the result since its inception. Blockchain technology has evolved from initial cryptocurrency to new-age smart contracts and has been implemented and applied in many fields. Although a lot of studies have been carried out on the security and privacy issues of blockchain, but a systematic examination on the security of blockchain systems is still missing. In this chapter, we will try to demonstrate a systematic illustration on the security threats to blockchain and survey the corresponding real attacks by examining popular blockchain systems. We will discuss the security and the privacy of blockchain along with their impact with regards to different trends and applications in this chapter. The chapter is intended to discuss key security attacks and the enhancements that will help develop better blockchain systems.</td>

      <td>The introduction and enactment of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) have initiated a global revolution. The volume and variety of data that are collected and processed in industries are ever increasing due to the widespread acceptance of modern technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, edge computing, and cloud storage. Conventional systems with centralized architecture are not designed to handle the complexity and scale of data that is processed in IIoT operations. Moreover, the threat of security and privacy breaches also increases with the growth of IIoT-connected devices. IoT devices often tend to have poor security defense systems due to low processing power, limited storage capabilities, and poor manufacturing standards. In this context, blockchain technology can help to eliminate the security vulnerabilities faced by the IIoT systems and provides extensive protection from data thefts, cyberattacks, and data corruption. Blockchain with its distributed architecture offers peer-to-peer networking and enables auditable and transparent transactions. This chapter explores the concept of IIoT and its limitations, and the need for deploying blockchain mechanisms in the IIoT paradigm. We further analyze blockchain technology and how it can reinforce IIoT systems. Existing systems of blockchain in the IIoT ecosystems and relevant use cases are also explored. As conventional systems struggle to handle the scale of data operations handled by the IIoT, blockchain has emerged as a viable solution to reinforce and reform existing systems.</td>

For example, it is widely acknowledged that the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has introduced complexity to the cyberspace, however, incident responders should also realise the advantages presented by these new “Digital Witnesses” (DW) to support their investigation. Logs generated by IoT devices can help in the process of event reconstruction, but their integrity -and therefore admissibility- can be achieved only if a Chain-of-Custody (CoC) is maintained within the wider context of an on-going digital investigation. Likewise, the transition to electronic documentation improves data availability, legibility, the utility of notes, and therefore enhances the communication between stakeholders. However, without a proof of validity, these data could be falsified. For example, in an application area such as eHealth, there is a requirement to maintain various existing (and new) rules and regulations concerning authorship, auditing, and the integrity of medical records. Lacking data control could lead to system abuse, fraud and severe compromise of service quality. These concerns can be resolved by implementing an online CoC. In this paper, we discuss the value and means of utilising Blockchain in modern systems to support DFIR. we demonstrate the value of Blockchain to improve the implementation of Digital Forensic Models and discuss why law enforcement and incident responders need to understand Blockchain technology. Furthermore, the admissibility of a Digital Evidence to a Court of Law requires chronological documentation. Hence, we discuss how the CoC can be sustained based on a distributed ledger. Finally, we provide a practical scenario related to eHealth to demonstrate the value of this approach to introduce forensic readiness to computer systems and enable better Police interventions.</td>

Medical records can be much more valuable to criminals than financial data, indeed the control of medical data allows criminals to plan and realize different frauds, that the victims may identify only too late. Furthermore, the complexity of a typical H4.0 cyber-physical system makes healthcare records particularly vulnerable. Blockchain is today an emerging technology for the management of data that may avoid or mitigate the impact of threats related to data storage and management, in general, and to the administration, in particular, of healthcare records. The blockchain technology relies on cryptography and distributed consensus to guarantee data integrity, accountability and security. The exploitation of such technology is considered in this chapter, showing the advantages when used in a H4.0 scenario.</td>

Since the first crafting of absorptive capacity theory in the beginning of 1990s, there has been ample research on its application in medium and large companies. The contribution of this study is that it assesses the concept of absorptive capacity and its impact on firm performance in start-ups. The methodological approach involves quantitative data analysis using a survey applied to a sample of 44 blockchain start-ups measuring the following variables: acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation. We analyzed firm performance through a variety of concepts previously tested in other studies, sales growth, profit growth, growth in market share, and growth in return on capital, and found a positive relationship between AC and firm performance in blockchain start-ups. However, based on our findings, we cannot conclude that blockchain start-ups are more successful because of their AC.

At times, the importance of the specification stage gets neglected by software engineers while developing software systems. Software engineering life cycle models are improved for better software quality and reliability. Even though powerful implementation strategies exist, if the requirements of a system to be developed are unclear and not specified properly, then the product can fail to satisfy user needs. Traditional methods use natural language for specifying the requirements of the software systems. The use of formal specifications to specify software systems remains a challenging research problem that needs to be addressed. In this research effort, several healthcare applications that are implemented using Blockchain are studied. Blockchain is a recent invention that uses the idea of decentralization to enforce security. Such applications come with complexity and specifying requirements for such systems using formal specification languages gets even more challenging. The challenges involved in writing formal specifications for such complex applications has been studied in this research effort. The Descartes specification language, a formal executable formal specification language, is used to specify the blockchain healthcare applications under study. Case study examples are used to illustrate the specification of Blockchain healthcare application requirements using the Descartes specification language.</td>

Various application scenarios emerge, such as include data centers, storage in wireless networks and peer-to-peer storage systems. Storing data by using code, such as an erasure code, calls for less redundancy compared with simple replication in terms of reliability. Nevertheless, since data fragments are periodically replaced when some nodes fail, a key acute question is how to generate encoded data fragments in a distributed way when transferring as little data as possible over the network. For a coded system, a new node to repair from a node failure is to download subsets of data from some surviving nodes, reconstructs some lost coded blocks by using the downloaded fragments, and stores them at the new node. This procedure is not optimal. In this paper, we introduce blockchain to protect distributed data in terms of node failure and etc. We show that blockchain can significantly improve the integrity and credibility in distributed file storage systems. Furthermore, we harvest theory discovery of blockchain in distributed file storage system.</td>

Any security flaw occurring during authentication with a centralized environment affects the connectivity of devices in the network and the transaction of data in IoT. As a solution, Blockchain technology emerges to use in IoT network for the betterment. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the collection of medical devices and applications that connect to healthcare IT systems. In IoMT environment, a private Blockchain network is created containing all the participants of a hospital including doctors, lab technicians, patients and clinical laboratories etc., There exists no necessity to carry the report by the patients during every visit, as the data is already available in the network. The data is completely decentralized to avoid failure, data loss and to provide faster recovery. Whenever a change is attempted by a third person in the database, a notification is sent to all the members of the group. Since this is a private Blockchain, it requires an additional level of authentication. Whenever any new person requires being a part of the network a document for proof is provided. The data is transparent, so any modification done by any member of the group will get notified to everyone. An additional level security can be provided for data transfer based upon the mutually agreed security parameter and any modification in database is accepted upon approval of all members. In addition, when a hospital is not able to provide any sophisticated treatment to the patient due to lack of medical facilities, recommendation is sent to the patient; thereby new hospital added to the private network after successful authentication to access patient’s record. To access record, quantum key may be generated and distributed across the network.\n</td>

Blockchain platforms are currently being used across the world in several government processes and business domains, for their unique characteristics. Even though blockchain shows potentials in its ability to provide a limitless number of inventive commercial trading, payments, government, healthcare, military and other critical applications, they face a security weakness on their recent prominent breaches of exchanges. Hence, there remain major security issues that are essential to be overcome before blockchain adopts the mainstream. And currently, this technology relies on hardware security modules (HSM) for the management and protection of their digital keys. The HSM generates key pairs, has secure storage and can off-load cryptographic operations from the entire system. But recently, FPGAs are preferred for hardware realization of algorithms considering its flexibility, low cost and long-term maintenance. It also has an advantage of reconfigurable or reprogrammable hardware design whenever new security or adaptation of an algorithm is required to support higher security levels. The paper presents a review of hardware security modules and proposed to enhance the scalability and reliability of the HSM by implementing it with the silicon-based secure module. Integrating PUF technology into the chip for storing and securing encryption or private keys, its security level can also be improved.</td>

      <td>Today, supply chain finance is a very important topic. Traditional supply chains rely on banks to support the related financing activities and services. With the emergence of blockchain technology, more and more companies in different industries have considered using it to support supply chain finance. In this paper, we study supply chain financing problems in supply chains selling fashionable products. Modeling under the standard newsvendor problem setting with a single manufacturer and a single retailer employing a revenue sharing contract, we develop analytical models for both the traditional and blockchain-supported supply chains. We derive the optimal contracting and quantity decisions in each supply chain with Nash bargaining between the manufacturer and retailer. We analytically show how the revenue sharing contract can coordinate both types of supply chains. We then compare the optimal systems performances between the two supply chains. We prove that the blockchain-supported supply chain incurs a lower level of operational risk than the traditional supply chain. We have shown that if the service fees by banks are sufficiently high, adopting blockchain technology is a mean-risk dominating policy which brings a higher expected profit and a lower risk for the supply chain and its members. For robustness checking, we examine other commonly seen supply chain contracts and alternative risk measures, and analytically reveal that the results remain valid.</td>

Creation of identity document requires an individual to convince appropriate government authority by producing all supporting proofs of identity declaration. This process is vulnerable as it can result in the accumulation of power to the individual issuing the identity document. Also, the authentication process involves sharing the copy of already issued identity proof. Many a time, identity proofs are shared with individuals who cannot be trusted for their integrity. This can result in misuse of the identity documents for socially evil activities. Blockchain provides a decentralized trust-less network which nobody owns, but everyone can use. The proposed system provides solution to the identity management problem by putting personal identifiers on blockchain. Using blockchain technology, a system has been proposed to create, manage and confirm an individual’s identity and credentials in a much secure way. Sharing of relevant information would be possible only with the identity owner’s will. Hence, creation of false identity documents will be prevented.</td>

It’s true that blockchain has its roots in cryptocurrency applications and is still evolving for that purpose in the financial sector, but many other organisations across different industries are beginning to see the non-crypto use cases where this mechanism to record data that cannot be changed or reversed or apply as smart contracts (as a way to time-stamp transactions between parties) is becoming extremely relevant and purposeful. A variety of industry sectors, besides Finance, has undertaken the use of these distributed technologies and beneficial attributes of blockchain from the healthcare and pharmaceutical, real estate, retail and supply chain, legal and publishing. Organisations have flexible options to run blockchain as permissionless (anyone can join), permissioned (where those need to be invited) or hybrid (a consortium type) and whether data should be held on-chain or off-chain. With industry entering its fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) the addition of blockchain as a complimentary technology has its place and there are some industries very suited to the significant impact it may bring. Also, the advances of Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence has meant more pressures on potential impacts to data and the ripple effects that cyber-attacks may cause. This has also become complicated, as cyber-attacks have become much more sophisticated over recent years with the different configuration types and various industry sectors have suffered from a range of these different attack vectors, resulting in some devastating outcomes. These have manifested in the shape of ransomware, malware, manipulation methods, phishing and spear-phishing. Whilst data breaches are a serious incident, in most organisations, there is a growing concern regarding attacks that are designed to have a more destructive effect such as the Ukraine cyber-attack in 2015 that resulted in a shutdown of the power grid or the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 that caused widespread chaos with healthcare institutions unable to carry out any tasks since access to data/systems was unavailable.</td>

In addition, the effect of applying blockchain platforms on a case study is presented and analyzed from performance and security level. The analysis aims to emphasize that blockchain, as presented in this paper, is a viable solution to the challenges in the CSC regardless of the risks associated with the security and robustness of the flow of information and data protection. Moreover, a threat analysis of applying a blockchain model on the CSC industry is introduced. This model indicates potential attacks and possible countermeasures to prevent the attacks. Future work is needed to expand, quantify, and optimize the threat model and conduct simulations considering proposed countermeasures for the different blockchain attacks outlined in this study.</td>

      <td>The Internet of Things (IoTs) enables coupling of digital and physical objects using worthy communication technologies and introduces a future vision where computing systems, users and objects cooperate for convenience and economic benefits. Such a vision requires seamless security, data privacy, authentication and robustness against attacks. These attributes can be introduced by blockchain, a distributed ledger that maintains an immutable log of network transactions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on how to remodel blockchain to the specific IoT needs in order to develop Blockchain based IoT (BIoT) applications and aim to shape a coherent picture of the current state-of-the-art efforts in this direction. After describing the basic characteristics and requirements of IoT, evolution of blockchain is presented. In this regard, we start with the fundamental working principles of blockchain and how such systems achieve auditability, security and decentralization. Further, we describe the most relevant BIoT applications, its architecture design and security aspects. From there, we build our narrative on the centralized IoT challenges followed by recent advances towards solving them. Finally, some future directions are enumerated with the aim to guide future BIoT researchers on challenges that needs to be considered ahead of deploying the next generation of BIoT applications.</td>

Moving from a centralized data storage paradigm to the distributed ledger technology without central data storage raises important challenges, mostly in terms of scalability, integrity, and privacy. Even though decentralization, each node within the blockchain network implements a storage mechanism to keep track of the blockchain states. In this paper, we perform a detailed study of selected blockchain platforms in order to discover which underlying database solutions they use to store blockchain states. Our results show that 13 out of 20 platforms use key-value stores (LevelDB or RocksDB), write-optimized storage solutions able to perform fast lookups due to their underlying indexing structure used. Moreover, there are also platforms, which make use of the benefits of relational and document-oriented databases.</td>

      <td>The blockchain technology emerged in 2008 as a distributed peer to peer network structure, capable of ensuring security for transactions made using the Bitcoin digital currency, without the need for third party intermediaries to validate them. Although its beginning was linked to cryptocurrencies, its use has diversified over the recent years. There are various projects using the blockchain technology to perform document validation, electronic voting, tokenization of non-perishable goods, and many others. With its increasing use, concern arises with possible attacks that could threaten the integrity of the consensus of the chain. One of the well-known attacks to the blockchain consensus mechanism is the selfish mining attack, in which malicious nodes can deflect their behavior from the standard pattern by not immediately disclosing their newly mined blocks. This malicious behavior can result in a disproportionate share of rewards for those nodes, especially if they have a significant processing power. The goal of this paper is to present a simple heuristic to detect the presence of selfish mining attack (and variants) in blockchain networks that use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm. The proposal is to signal when the blockchain fork height deviates from the standard, indicating when the network is under the influence of such attacks.</td>

In order to enact choreographies in a trust-less environment, blockchain-based implementations have been proposed. They support trustful interactions, i.e., information generated on the blockchain during execution is trustworthy. However, existing solutions employ blockchain data that are bound to a single choreography. This paper proposes a novel approach to implement choreographies on the blockchain in a way that the generated data can be reused by different choreographies leading to cost reduction without sacrificing data integrity. The approach is evaluated in terms of feasibility and costs by developing a prototype based on the Ethereum blockchain.</td>
